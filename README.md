# AddonForSkillAPI
A spigot plugin that adds extra features for SkillAPI plugin

Hey folks! I've been waiting a bit to release my own addon for the SkillAPI Plugin.
It adds lots of new features that you might find useful for your server that uses
SkillAPI.

Here is a list of what my Addon does:

- Damage / Heal Holograms Indicators
- Different icons for different damage classifiers
- Choice between vanilla armor stands or armor stand packets
- Skill cast fail sound effect
- Better Chat Prefix, including Level
- Cast skills on drinking potions

Everything in my plugin is toggleable, so if you don't like a feature, feel free to disable it!

Commands:
/afs reload - reloads the config
